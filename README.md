# FaceDetection_and_Image2Text
Detects faces in a photo and can read Newspapers from images. Implemented using OpenCV, Pillow and Tesseract libraries in python. Assignment of a Coursera course by UoMichigan.

*OpenCV* was used to detect faces, *Tesseract* to perform optical character recognition, and *PIL* to compile images into contact sheets.

## CODE DETAILS ##
* __*text_face_detection.py*__ : The code allows one to search through images looking for the occurences of keywords and faces. Eg. If we search for a word "pizza", it will return a contact sheet with all the faces which were located in the newspaper page with the word pizza in it. To see sample output, checout the image  __*Detection.png*__  with the screenshot of the ipython notebook which itself got deleted.

* __*PixelTransform.png*__ : Contains basic pixel transformation code to to learn the PIL library.
